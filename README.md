## Abstract  
In this project, we investigated the performance of a logistic regression model on one benchmark dataset, the **CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset**. Our analysis covered various aspects of model performance, including **training-test split evaluations, feature weight importance, and the impact of training size and mini-batch configurations**. Our findings reveal that **the choice of hyperparameters is crucial to model performance**.
